Monolithic Architecture
- built as a single unit 
- deployed as a single unit
- dedicated on each server
- even though it has different layers - web, business and data



Microservices Architecture
- A variant of the service-oriented architecture(SOA) style that arranges an application
as collection of loosely coupled services.
- In morcoservices architecture, services are light weight and the protocols
are lightweight
- segregates functionality into smaller separate services each with single
responsibility
- scales out by deploying each service independently and loosely coupled
- enables autonomous development by different teams, languages and platforms
- can be written by smaller teams
- each microservice can own it's own database

Microservices benifits 
- improved isolation
- eliminage vendor and technology lock-in 
- ease of understanding
- smaller and faster deployments
- scalability


Cloud Native
- is an approach in S/W that utilizes cloud computing to build and run scalable solutions
in modern and dynamic environments using Containers, service meshes, immutable infrastructure
and declarative API's. 
- enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, managable and observable.
