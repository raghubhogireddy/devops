# Monolithic Architecture
- Built and deployed as a single unit 
- Dedicated on each server
- Even though it has different layers - web, business and data

## Microservices Architecture
- A variant of the service-oriented architecture(SOA) style that arranges an application as collection of loosely coupled services.
- In morcoservices architecture, services and the protocols
are lightweight.
- Segregates functionality into smaller separate services and each with single responsibility.
- Scales out by deploying each service independently and loosely coupled.
- Enables autonomous development by different teams, languages and platforms
- Can be written by smaller teams
- Each microservice can own it's own database

## Microservices benifits 
- Improved isolation
- Eliminate vendor and technology lock-in 
- Ease of understanding
- Smaller and faster deployments
- Scalability


## Cloud Native
- Is an approach in S/W that utilizes cloud computing to build and run scalable solutions
in modern and dynamic environments using Containers, service meshes, immutable infrastructure
and declarative API's. 
- Enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, managable and observable.
